The application was build in Python Flask. Main idea of the project is to create API’s and call it using requests in order to retrieve data such as: temperature, coordonates from cities, countries. I used Docker to connect the Flask application to a MySQL Database.
• To test the integrity and reliability of data I used MySQL Workbench as the visualisation tool. To test the functionality I used PostMan.
